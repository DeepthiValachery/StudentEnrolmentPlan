The one I repeated in summer had roughly 80-90 people enrolled but an attendance of ~50 (so it felt much smaller). There were no labs and the syllabus was much more condensed, omitting a few things and paying less attention to others.

The one I repeated during the school year had roughly the same size (as far as i could tell) and lecture sizes (although started with a full room), dwindled to around 60-100 students. The labs are relatively the same size, though the tutor changed. I had a different lecturer compared to year prior as well, although I stayed in the 'group 1' time slot.

In a way, it comforts me to know that I'm not in this alone. With regards to teaching, I find that it's much nicer to just sit and listen to what the professor is communicating, rather than having smaller, interactive classes. I do learn quite a lot in smaller classes, since it's easier to ask questions and engage in discussions, but I learn a lot as well in large classes, too, unless the course content is not appealing enough to hold my attention (in the case of being a necessary core course, but, for instance, being based more on another subject than the subject I am interested in)."
